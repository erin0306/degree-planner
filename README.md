## Courses and Degree Planner

by Erin Chang, Khoa Luong

Access the web app [here](https://uw-course-and-degree-planner.firebaseapp.com/).

### Purpose

The purpose of this web app is to help UW students explore different classes or programs and plan their degree accordingly. Students will be able to find courses through using keywords and filters, or they can look at the recommendation made to them based on their program and completed courses.


### Instruction

Upon login, students should be able to add completed courses and planned courses through clicking on links on the dashboard, or they can access those feature through the side navigation. 

Once they have added completed courses, they can see their graduation progress through the dashboard and can filter courses based on prerequisites to see the ones they are eligible to take. 

If students have yet to add any completed courses, they will only see courses without any prerequisites.

Students can type in the department code and filter courses based on Areas of Knowledge, quarter offered, campus, etc. They can also add courses to their future plan. They can remove planned courses in the search result or on Your Plan page.

On the Program page, students can explore different programs by clicking on any one of the programs in the list. It will lead them to another page with detailed description and requirement of each program. They can add any of them to their plan and it will be updated in their dashboard.
