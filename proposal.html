        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Students in UW often have trouble finding a major they want to study due to the competitive major system or the lack of good information on what degree they can pursue. Figuring out an alternative major, minor, or options can be a very difficult task because each major or department has its own website and different ways presenting that information. Finding classes to take can also be tedious because even if some classes are listed on the website, they might have never been offered in the last few years.  For example, UW has a different <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/info.html">website for all the classes in a program</a>, but to check their availability, one needs to go to <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/">another page</a> under UW and go through at least 5 clicks to reach the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/SPR2019/info.html">past schedule page</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently, the only way for students to acquire that information is to go through numerous amount of websites from each department trying to figure out what each program is about and what classes are offered. So far <a href="https://myplan.uw.edu/home/#/">MyPlan</a>, UW's registration and class planning system, only shows what classes are needed to graduate from a program, but it does not show students what program also shares a similar curriculum, or in another word, what other programs can a particular class or a set of classes fulfill. More often than not, MyPlan will redirect the user to the department's website in order to see the electives available, which makes class planning even more difficult.</p>
        <p>This is a problem not only for people trying to find a major but also for people who are looking to pursue double major, minor, or options, which is fairly common in UW as the school requires a lot of general education credits outside of one's major in order to graduate.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>The users of this application will be UW students who are trying to find a suitable major, double major, minor, option, or just classes that fit their needs.</p>
        <p>The users will be able to see a list of major, minor, or options related to either a keyword or classes that the user is taking. The user should also be able to request for a suggested major or minor based on courses they are interested in taking or graduation requirements they haven't fulfilled. The application should also be able to help students find suitable classes based on their specific needs, such as program requirements, ratings (e.g. <a href="https://www.washington.edu/cec/toc.html">Course Evaluation Catalog</a>), prerequisites, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/">availability in the past few years</a>, etc. Students should also be able to provide extra information about a course after taking them, so other students will be able to discover a course more easily.</p>
        <p>Finding interesting classes or programs can be difficult. Using this application will make planning courses more easy and efficient. The suggestion feature should hopefully help students discover programs or classes that they never thought existed or would be interested in at all.</p>

            <h3>App Functionality</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The user will input either a keyword, course number, or program name into the search bar.</li>
                <li>Then they can use the filter to select what type of result they are looking for, e.g. major, minor, or similar classes. The application will display all the programs or classes related to the search.</li>
                <li>The user can choose to add more classes to the search to narrow down the results by typing more words separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The user can also click on the result to see the detail of the program/course and see what similarity it has. The application should highlight the part that matches the search, e.g. "this program also takes INFO 340", "this program has many overlapping requirements or electives such as..." or "this class also teaches web development."</li>
