        "description" : "The School of Art serves a dual role within the University of Washington â€” both a professional school and an academic department. As a professional school it trains students for active careers in the visual arts; as a school of the College of Arts and Sciences it offers studio and lecture courses. All course offerings and curriculum requirements are based on the underlying philosophy that an awareness and understanding of the visual arts are necessary to a liberal education, and that a liberal education is necessary to the training of a professional artist."
